 **Warning: work in progress**
 
 WebMaker2000 is an in-place static site generator, meaning processed files are
 stored right next to their sources. This simplifies composing (source dir
-layout _is_ finished website layout) and publishing (simply `rsync`/`git push`
-your whole dir).
+layout _is_ finished website layout; static assets no longer need to be moved
+around) and publishing (simply `rsync`/`git push` your whole dir). It aims to
+be beginner-friendly while encouraging users to fiddle with html/css. To that
+end, the core feature set is purposefully simple:
+
+- [x] Finds all `*.dj` files, generates `*.html` in the same place
+    + Per-page metadata allows using custom template
+- [x] Generates home page, which is just a predefined `index.dj` + custom
+  template. This means the user is free to swap in their own custom home page.
+- [x] Generates RSS/Atom feed
+
+Quality-of-life features are not neglected:
+
+- [x] Livereload with no browser plugin (works but currently polls which is
+  noisy, should probably upgrade to websockets)
+- [ ] Shows user error messages on the livereloaded web page
+- [ ] Just enough GUI so user doesn&#39;t have to touch a terminal
+- [ ] 1-click deploy to popular static hosting targets (git push, rsync, etc.)
 
 There&#39;s a sample site up at &lt;https://nhanb.github.io/webmaker2000/about/&gt; which
 also further explains why this project exists.
