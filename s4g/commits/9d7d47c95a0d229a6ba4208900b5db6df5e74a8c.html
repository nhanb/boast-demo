+# Dev notes
+
+`writeablefs` is admittedly an unnecessary abstraction. The prospect of
+replacing the native filesystem backend with something else is highly unlikely
+in the first place. I simply wanted to get used to the ergonomics of
+programming portably against an FS interface. I&#39;ve already violated that in my
+recent commits anyway. When I&#39;m sufficiently bored I&#39;ll most likely remove it
+wholesale.
