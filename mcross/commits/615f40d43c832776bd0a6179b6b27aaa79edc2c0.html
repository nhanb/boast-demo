 # Feature checklist
 
 - [x] back-forward buttons
+- [ ] handle redirects
 - [ ] separate I/O thread to avoid blocking GUI
 - [ ] more visual indicators - maybe a status bar at the bottom
 - [x] parse gemini&#39;s advanced line types
+- [ ] properly handle mime types (gemini/plaintext/binary)
 - [ ] configurable document styling
 - [ ] configurable TLS to accomodate self-signed sites?
+- [ ] human-friendly distribution
 
 Long term high-level goals:
 
-- Should be easy for end users to install. If the word `rustup` exists in the
-  installation guide for your G U I application then I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s not
-  software made for people to _use_.
-- Should be responsive &amp; pleasant to use. The Castor browser doesn&#39;t have
-  visual indicators at all, for example, when clicking on a link it just
-  appears to do nothing until the new page is completely loaded.
-- The viewport should be rendered so that its content can be copied and still
-  remain equivalent, valid gemini markup. Abolish the content creator vs
-  consoomer divide!
-- Lightweight, in terms of both disk space &amp; memory/cpu usage. It&#39;s completely
-  unoptimized at the moment but tkinter and zero-dependency python gives us a
-  fairly good starting point imo.
