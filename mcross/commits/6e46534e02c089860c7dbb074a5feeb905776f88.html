 McRoss is a WIP [gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) browser
 written in python and tkinter.
 
-It&#39;s developed against gemini://gemini.circumlunar.space/ because apparently
-that&#39;s the only server with a valid, CA-approved TLS cert.

 It currently looks like this:

+# Development

+Deps:
 
 - python3.7+
 - idlelib (it&#39;s supposed to be in the standard lib but Ubuntu for example
   splits it into a separate package)
 
+To get started:
+
+```sh
+pyenv install 3.7.7
+pyenv virtualenv 3.7.7 mcross
+pyenv activate
+poetry install
+mcross
+
+# to publish, first bump version in pyproject.toml then
+poetry publish --build

+Long term high-level goals:
+
+- Should be easy for end users to install. If the word `rustup` exists in the
+  installation guide for your G U I application then I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s not
+  software made for people to _use_.
+- Should be responsive &amp; pleasant to use. The Castor browser doesn&#39;t have
+  visual indicators at all, for example, when clicking on a link it just
+  appears to do nothing until the new page is completely loaded.
+- The viewport should be rendered so that its content can be copied and still
+  remain equivalent, valid gemini markup. Abolish the content creator vs
+  consoomer divide!
+- Lightweight, in terms of both disk space &amp; memory/cpu usage. It&#39;s completely
+  unoptimized at the moment but tkinter and zero-dependency python gives us a
+  fairly good starting point imo.
