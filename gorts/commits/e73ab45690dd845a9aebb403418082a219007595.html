+
+GORTS is written in the Go programing language, which suffers from false
+positives more often than usual. See &lt;https://go.dev/doc/faq#virus&gt;:
+
+&gt; Why does my virus-scanning software think my Go distribution or compiled
+&gt; binary is infected?
+&gt;
+&gt; This is a common occurrence, especially on Windows machines, and is almost
+&gt; always a false positive. Commercial virus scanning programs are often
+&gt; confused by the structure of Go binaries, which they don&#39;t see as often as
+&gt; those compiled from other languages.
+
+So no, I&#39;m not trying to hackerman you. If you&#39;re really concerned, feel free
+to audit the code and compile GORTS yourself. There&#39;s really not that much
+code.

+# Compile from source
 
 Can cross-compile from any unix-like. I&#39;m cheating a little though, by
 downloading a prebuilt tcl executable for Windows, and just assume Linux users
