+Title: Introducing Pytaku - the last online manga reader you&#39;ll ever need
+Date: 2015-01-02 21:19
+Category: Pytaku
+
+[Pytaku][pytaku] is an online manga reader that scrapes data from multiple Vietnamese and Enligsh
+manga sites, giving you one single place to keep track of your reading progress and watch for new
+chapters with ease. Here are some of the features implemented so far:
+
+## Lightning fast, ad-free reading experience
+
+All pages in a chapter are loaded at once, unlike most other sites that only let you view one page
+at a time, forcing you to reload their distracting advertisements and disrupt you flow (especially
+for people with not-so-fast internet connection).
+
+And it gets better: using state-of-the-art AJAX dark magic, even navigation between chapters is
+lightning fast. Loaded pages are cached, so pressing &quot;Back&quot; or &quot;Forward&quot; on your browser happens
+instantly.
+
+## Keep track of your reading progress. Automatically.
+
+Each logged in user will have a nice badge on each chapter showing their progress: (keeping a
+chapter page open for a few seconds registers it as &quot;reading&quot;, and scrolling to the bottom marks it
+as &quot;finished&quot;)
+

+
+## Bookmark series to watch for updates
+
+Maintain a list of series so you can have one single place to find out whether there are new
+chapters for the series you love.
+

+
+## English, Vietnamese and support for other languages
+
+Pytaku comes in English by default and configurable to be in Vietnamese. If you want to translate
+it to your own language, feel free to download the [English language file][4] and start translating
+on that, then send it to me to install.
+
+![Vietnamese interface][img3]
+
+## Open source and free to run your own site
+
+Pytaku&#39;s source code is released under the permissive MIT license and [put on GitHub][1].  Since
+it&#39;s written to be run on Google App Engine which is free for small sites, tech-savvy people can
+set up their own private pytaku clone in a few minutes. Check out the [README file][2] for
+instructions.
+
+## Open to suggestions and (hopefully contructive) criticism
+
+Want another manga site to be included as source? Need a feature that you think many others can
+benefit from? Feel free to open an issue on GitHub, or give me a shout on the official [support
+chat room][3].
+
+## Give it a spin
+
+[Click here][pytaku] to go to the app. Have fun! :)
