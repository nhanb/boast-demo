    update proper ARTICLE_PATHS, remove cruft
    
    Limit article parsing to `posts/` only, effectively prevents pelican
    from parsing static stuff from `extras/` (it previously tried to do so
    which eventually failed to copy the *.html static files altogether)
    
    Also remove unnecessary PLUGIN_PATH and cal.html.
