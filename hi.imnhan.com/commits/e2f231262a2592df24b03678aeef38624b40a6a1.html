+Title: Fix RMIT wi-fi issue in Ubuntu 13.04 and variants
+Date: 2013-06-17 08:12

+Slug: fix-rmit-wifi-issue-in-ubuntu-13-04-and-variants
+Summary: The problem is NetworkManager, there&#39;s a workaround but nobody has been assigned to formally fix it.
+
+## The issue
+
+When I upgraded to Xubuntu 13.04, although I could connect to any other wi-fi network painlessly,
+the RMIT-WPA network just never allowed me to establish a connection. The most annoying part was
+that it had been working fine in previous versions (12.04, 12.10).
+
+After days of googling, I finally pinpointed the issue: a certain version of NetworkManager
+bundled in Ubuntu 13.04 has a bug that automatically turn CA certificate usage to *true* for any
+WPA2 wifi network, even if we choose to use none in the GUI.
+

+
+## The solution
+
+Just manually edit `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/RMIT-WPA`, make sure that you have
+`system-ca-certs=false`, then restart the wifi connection. To edit this file you will need root
+permission. If you&#39;re not sure how to do this, open a terminal and enter this command to open
+`gedit` with sudo permission (`mousepad` if you&#39;re using xubuntu):
+
+    :::bash
+    # Protip: DON&#39;T use sudo for GUI programs! Use gksudo instead.
+    gksudo gedit /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/RMIT-WPA
+
+This is a [known bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/network-manager/+bug/1104476) and
+many have complained about it. There seems to be no developer assigned to fix it though. I&#39;ll keep
+you updated on the issue.
