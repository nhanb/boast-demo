+Title: I made my python webapp pip-installable
+Date: 2021-10-02 19:49
+
+Running `pip3 install pytaku` now gives you all the tools you need [^1] to
+deploy [pytaku][3] - a hobby webapp of mine - on a fresh Debian 11 server:
+
+```sh
+pytaku-generate-config &gt; pytaku.conf.json  # generate config file
+pytaku-migrate  # generate initial sqlite3 db, or migrate to new version
+pytaku -w 5  # run main webapp using gunicorn on localhost:8000
+pytaku-scheduler  # daemon that executes scheduled background tasks
+
+# Optionally, run this to copy all static assets to a designated dir so your
+# web server (nginx/caddy/etc.) can serve them directly instead of through
+# the less performant gunicorn:
+pytaku-collect-static /var/www/pytaku
+```
+
+So how does that work? Let&#39;s break it down.
+
+## The pytaku-\* executables
+
+[Poetry][4] is awesome. Not only does it offer sane dependency management that
+plays well with the pyenv + virtualenv combo, but it also vastly simplifies
+building and publishing python libraries. Telling pip to install executables
+alongside my library is as simple as writing a few lines in my
+[pyproject.toml][5] file:
+
+```toml
+[tool.poetry.scripts]
+pytaku = &quot;pytaku:serve&quot;
+pytaku-dev = &quot;pytaku:dev&quot;
+pytaku-migrate = &quot;pytaku:migrate&quot;
+pytaku-generate-config = &quot;pytaku:generate_config&quot;
+pytaku-scheduler = &quot;pytaku:scheduler&quot;
+pytaku-collect-static = &quot;pytaku:collect_static&quot;
+```
+
+The left hand side indicates the executable file name, while the right hand
+side declares which function to call. In my example, &quot;pytaku:serve&quot; points to
+the serve() function inside src/pytaku/\_\_init\_\_.py.
+
+Now that we have easy access to CLI entry points, let&#39;s quickly go over
+[how][7] each command works:
+
+- `pytaku` and `pytaku-dev` simply exec gunicorn and flask respectively
+  behind the scene.
+- `pytaku-migrate` runs my bespoke migrator script (which is extremely
+  primitive but hey it was a good learning experience).
+- `pytaku-generate-config` uses [goodconf][6] to generate a config template,
+  pre-filling as many values as it can.
+- `pytaku-scheduler` is just a dead simple single-threaded scheduler that I
+  don&#39;t recommend for any service that has more than a handful of users.
+- `pytaku-collect-static` leverages importlib.resources.path to get the
+  package&#39;s installation path. From there it copies the bundled static assets
+  to wherever you want your nginx to serve. It&#39;s basically a simplified version
+  of Django&#39;s collectstatic command.
+
+## But why bother?
+
+Lincoln Loop&#39;s series of Django-related blog posts were my main inspiration.
+Central to this idea is [Using setup.py in Your (Django) Project][8], which
+explains both how and why you would want to make your python project
+pip-friendly. The &quot;why&quot; boils down to 2 points:
+
+- You don&#39;t want to reinvent package management. Let pip handle the minute
+  details of packaging, distributing, versioning, etc. for you.
+- You no longer need to run python from the source code&#39;s path. In pytaku&#39;s
+  case, the working dir now only stores the sqlite database file and the
+  json config file, i.e. purely data, completely separate from the source
+  code.
+
+More broadly, the idea of simple distributing/deployment is, in my opinion,
+often overlooked these days. Fiddly deployment procedures are largely why
+Docker flourished: our industry just collectively gave up on self-contained
+software distribution and decided to ship a whole rootfs for each application
+process instead. Okay, I may be overreacting here, but I think it&#39;s at least
+fair to say that if every webdev shop standardized on shipping Go binaries
+statically compiled with musl libc, we&#39;d probably reach out for Docker less
+often. When I showed pytaku to a colleague of mine, his first question was
+essentially &quot;Dockerfile when?&quot;. Sure, Docker is neat and solves real problems,
+but how about we strive to avoid, or at least minimize, those problems in the
+first place? Remember, while container evangelists love harping on about
+negligible CPU overhead, they tend to gloss over the storage overhead:
+
+```sh
+$ docker image ls
+REPOSITORY   TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
+python       3-alpine   bcf864391ba1   3 weeks ago   45.1MB
+python       3-slim     66f4843b721f   3 weeks ago   122MB
+```
+
+And the operational complexity overhead. Did you know that by default Docker
+[completely sidesteps your firewall][9]? That even if you specifically tell it
+to only listen to a port on localhost, it may or may not still expose it to the
+whole world? That this remains an [open bug since 2016][10]? This isn&#39;t one of
+those security bogeyman stories either, actual people have been [bitten by
+it][11]. At this point cloud apologists would probably jump in and point out
+how this isn&#39;t an issue if you&#39;re running on GCP or AWS because they have
+another layer of firewall that locks down every port by default that you can
+setup on their totally usable web console or infrastructure-as-code it in your
+cloudformations or your terraformses or, actually, do you have a moment to talk
+about our lord and savior Cthulhubernetes-
+
+But I digress.
+
+I guess what I was trying to say is, throwing abstractions over complex
+procedures is simply shifting the costs elsewhere. Shipping your software in a
+Dockerfile is file, but making your distribution so simple that people can
+easily write a couple of lines of Dockerfile for it by themselves is more
+valuable.
+
+And other people _have_ been trying to make python application distribution
+simpler:
+
+- [shiv][12] bundles everything but the python interpreter
+- [PyOxidizer][13] bundles everything _including_ the python interpreter
+- [nuika][14] actually compiles your python application into an executable,
+  unlike PyInstaller which just generates a self-extracting archive.
+
+We&#39;ll get there. Someday.
+
+
+[^1]: Well actually you still need to `apt install python3-apsw`, but that&#39;s
+  only because apsw [refuses][2] to provide a binary wheel on pypi. It can be
+  replaced by the standard library sqlite3 module anyway - I only picked apsw
+  because it exposes essentially the same API as the SQLite C library, which
+  helped when I was learning to use SQLite properly for the first time.
+
+[^2]: Even with the above, pytaku still won&#39;t run out of the box because it
+  needs a [crappy proxy](https://github.com/nhanb/gae-proxy/) in order to
+  bypass mangasee&#39;s strict cloudflare protection. I know it&#39;s lame but pytaku
+  is practically a web scraper project and there&#39;s no way to make it work
+  reliably without a proxy pool anyway. I hope this doesn&#39;t distract you from
+  the point of the article though.
