+Title: Look ma, no stock theme!
+Date: 2015-06-05 13:54
+
+I just redesigned my blog.
+
+To be totally honest, the previous design was not mine at all. I&#39;ve always been using
+[pelican-octopress-them][1], which is a Pelican port of the default theme for Octopress. It&#39;s not
+that I have anything to complain about that theme: it was clean, readable and easy on the eyes. I
+just want my site to look unique. Content is king, sure, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to stand out from the
+crowd once in a while.
+
+I&#39;m not a professional designer, but everything turned out quite well if I could say so. In this
+post I&#39;ll explain my design goals and how I (hopefully) achieved them.
+
+## Clean and lightweight
+
+The web is messy. I&#39;m not talking blinking-marquee-fire-animated-header messy (thank god we&#39;re done
+with that... [or are we?][2]). I&#39;m talking megabytes-of-useless-javascript-and-css messy. For
+whatever reason, some people now think it&#39;s cool to include Bootstrap/Foundation to every project,
+or to include that new shiny parallax library to ruin scrolling for everybody. Oh, and don&#39;t forget
+the marvellous invention that is [&quot;infinite scrolling&quot;][3]:
+
+![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/infinite_scrolling.png)
+
+In fact, the main motivation of my new theme is [this satire page][4] on the sad state of the web
+we&#39;re in today.
+
+That&#39;s why I decided to do no fancy cosmetic JS and try to keep my use of static assets to a
+minimum:
+
+![](/images/mofo_01_loads.png)
+
+I guess I can do nothing about the font files though. Oh well, at least it looks awesome.
+
+## Content is king
+
+No more distracting sidebar with &quot;latest news&quot;, &quot;related posts&quot;, etc. with thumbnails popping up
+all over the place, just a good old article body from start to finish.
+
+## Easy on the eye
+
+While [bettermotherfuckingwebsite][5] does a good job at demonstrating how far you can go with a
+few simple CSS rules (hint: very far), I found Tommi Kaikkonen&#39;s [Interactive Guide to Blog
+Typography][6] much more comprehensive and informative. I implemented many of the ideas found
+in that guide:
+
+- Big body font
+- Constrained line width to aid reading
+- Generous line height, liberal whitespace to help with visual hierarchy
+- Lower background-foreground contrast. I also find the slightly yellow-ish background somewhat
+  soothing.
+
+## That&#39;s it!
+
+You can find the source code to my theme [on GitHub][7]. I don&#39;t recommend using it as-is though,
+since I haven&#39;t implemented many required templates (authors, tags, categories, etc.) because I
+don&#39;t use them. There&#39;s also the hardcoded footer. But honestly, the main reason is I just want my
+site to stay unique :P
