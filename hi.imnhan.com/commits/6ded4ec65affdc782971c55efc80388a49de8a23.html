 on Rachel By The Bay, the gist is:
 
 - Rollbacks should work. On every deployment.
+
 - A to AB to B (a.k.a. make before break):
     + v2 code/data should not break v1 code/data
+
 - Strict(er than JSON) schema-ing when you fling data across places
     + Protobuf, etc.
     + You should only _begin_ to consider JSON if you need to talk to browsers
+
 - Please fix 500s.
     + Also you should only get 400s when talking to external things out of your control

+Basically my TODOs, in pursuit of the ever-pervasive _pleasant workflow_.
+
+## Replacing tmux with kitty
+
+All blockers seem to have been addressed now?
+
+- [tmuxp replacement](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html#startup-sessions)
+- [seamless navigation alongside vimsplit](https://github.com/knubie/vim-kitty-navigator)
+
+
+## Interesting tools
+
+- [pyinfra](https://pointlessramblings.com/posts/why-you-should-try-pyinfra/):
+    + faster than ansible, from my anecdotal experience
+    + python, not yaml
+    + truly agentless (doesn&#39;t even require python)
+
+- [doit](https://pydoit.org/): I just want a cross-platform `make`.
+
+
+## Home server
+
+Specs:
+
+- Thinkpad T430 whose screen just broke
+- Accessible via Tailscale
+- Debian 10 installed on main SSD
+- 2x1TB Seagate HDDs, LUKS encrypted, running a RAID1 btrfs pool.
+
+Services:
+
+- [] Syncthing
+- [] Some RSS reader
+- [] Some bookmarking system that does full text search.
