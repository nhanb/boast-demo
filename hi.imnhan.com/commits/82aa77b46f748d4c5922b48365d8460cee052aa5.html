+Title: Acer Chromebook Spin 713 &quot;Voxel&quot;: an adequate Crostini device, a buggy Linux laptop
+Date: 2023-04-22 15:55
+Slug: acer-chromebook-spin
+Category: consoom
+
+**TL;DR:** bright crisp screen, acceptable keyboard, thin &amp; light build, buggy
+touchpad even on ChromeOS, almost usable on MrChromebox UEFI + Arch Linux
+except for the fact that sound crashes most of the time. It&#39;s absolutely not
+worth the sticker price at [$1,099.99][1] (lol). Maybe consider buying if you can
+find it at a heavy discount and the Linux sound issue has been fixed somehow.
+
+## Context
+
+Sometime in 2022 I was looking for a replacement for my T530---something
+lighter with a better screen---and saw a listing for a used Acer Chromebook
+Spin 713-3W at only 10mil VND ($425, give or take). A recently released HiDPI
+laptop with an i5-1135G7 at 425 freedom dollars? And I get to play with
+ChromeOS/Crostini on a not-pathetically-weak x86 device? Sign me right up, I
+thought. The plan was to run ChromeOS/Android apps for GUI stuff, and install
+my usual tmux+vim based development [environment][2] on Crostini.
+
+## ChromeOS/Crostini
+
+As advertised, the laptop can run ChromeOS apps, Android apps, and Linux apps
+via containers. By default I got a Debian container, but since I need
+up-to-date software for development, I set up an Arch container instead. [The
+process][3] itself was straightforward enough.
+
+Zoom for Android worked as expected, and to my surprise, Tailscale for Android
+managed to wrangle traffic correctly for programs running inside Crostini too!
+The only hiccup was that Magic DNS didn&#39;t work, so I needed to put the
+hostname-IP pairs into /etc/hosts manually. I also had to change the temp dir
+from /tmp to ~/tmp for golang tools to work, because Crostini programs weren&#39;t
+allowed to exec files inside /tmp or something like that.
