+## About me
+
+![My face](/static/images/nhan.jpg)
+
+My name is **Bùi Thành Nhân**. I&#39;m an undergraduate at RMIT Vietnam, focusing myself on web
+delvelopment, mostly backend but I&#39;m also taking huge interests in frontend frameworks too (twitter
+bootstrap, angularjs, etc.).
+
+I have a working knowledge of Java desktop programming, experience on web programming with PHP and
+setting up simple LAMP stacks. My current interests are python as a web backend language (django
+anyone?) and tinkering with frontend frameworks.
+
+I usually go with the handle **nhanb** on most social networks, you can find links to my profiles
+on the sidebar. In my free time I enjoy tinkering with shell scripts (sometimes pythons scripts
+too) to try out ways to improve productivity. When I&#39;m not being a nerd, you can find me hitting
+the gym (always going for the lighter dumbbells) or swimming.
+
+## About this blog
+
+My mind is a sad mess which cannot hold much important/interesting information after a couple of
+months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover, or practice expressing
+myself by writing technical tutorials. On occasional bad days I might throw all my ramblings here
+too, but hopefully those will be rare.
+
+I always appreciate feedback or further discussions on my posts, so feel free to point out if you
+think I said something stupid. That&#39;s it. Enjoy reading!
