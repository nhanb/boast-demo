+It&#39;s been a while since I [started][1] my arcade stick project. To be honest I got lazy and paused
+the whole thing for a while, but yesterday I needed a distraction so... everything came together
+much more nicely than I thought!
+
+## I did it!
+
+I was almost done in Part 1, except for the fact that button holes on the top panels didn&#39;t align,
+and the topmost panel flexed a bit because of imprecise screw holes:
+
+![Ewww](/images/fightstick_24_gap.jpg)
+
+To fix the button holes, I simply wrapped my roughest sandpaper around the drill bit and used it as
+a poor man&#39;s sander to make the holes slightly bigger, just enough for buttons to fit. This took a
+while because the sandpaper pieces kept failing on me. Good thing I stock a huge roll in the first
+place! :-)
+
+The flexing panel was surprisingly trivial to fix: I simply made one corner&#39;s hole a bit bigger to
+allow its screw to go all the way in properly. No more stupid gaps!
+
+Now that every piece was how it should be, the fun part began: assembling. The inside looked like
+this:
+

+
+Notice the knot where the USB cable poked out? It was there as a safeguard against pulling so that
+the PCB doesn&#39;t get yanked around. Later on I actually labeled every pair of wires for each button
+and secured the PCB better with more resilient tape, but I forgot to take photos and I&#39;m now too
+lazy to open up the whole thing again so... you get the idea.
+
+As for the top panel artwork, I planned quite a few colored designs, but was too lazy to go to a
+printing shop. As luck would have it, I had a black and white printer at home, so I grabbed some
+random Galford image on the internet and printed out one sheet just to see how it would look. It
+turned out much better than expected so I kept it that way.
+
+![](/images/fightstick2_02_top.jpg)
+
+Note that I bought translucent buttons. These are worth the higher price tag because it is possible
+to take them apart and [insert artwork pieces][2] under the cover. Just google custom fightsticks
+and you&#39;ll find people making use of these buttons with [stunning][3] [results][4]. But then again,
+I&#39;m a lazy butt so my minimalistic design actually saved me from some tedious button modding.
+Maybe when I get better inspirations, maybe.
+
+Following the monochrome theme, the placeholder &quot;Ken Flowchart&quot; bottom piece from last post became
+official (I also trimmed the excess paper later):
+

+
+Oh, and here&#39;s a front shot for completeness&#39; sake:
+

+
+## Thoughts
+
+All in all, this turned out much better than I expected. The whole thing feels solid to play with,
+and the plexiglass top panel makes a nice feeling palm rest. However, since I went a bit liberal on
+panel layers, it&#39;s a tad heavier than my previous stick (which is already heavier than your average
+big brand sticks). On the flip side, I can be more aggressive with my joystick spinning sessions
+thanks to the extra weight.
+
+I&#39;m also thinking of adding non-slip padding to the bottom. I almost exclusively play with the
+fightstick on my lap so it&#39;s not actually necessary gameplay-wise, but without padding, the bottom
+screw heads stick out and would definitely scratch my table whenever I place the stick on it.
+Better be safe than sorry!
+
+That&#39;s it! This project has been fun, and to me it served as an awesome gateway drug to the DIY
+world. Hopefully I inspired some of you to start your own projects too. Let me know how it goes!
