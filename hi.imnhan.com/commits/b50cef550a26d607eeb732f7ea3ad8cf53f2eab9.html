+Title: Projects
+Thumb: images/keyboard-warrior.jpg
+
+
+I&#39;ve written some open source software in my free time.
+In some cases I even maintain them! Shocking, I know.
+
+## McRoss
+
+[McRoss](https://sr.ht/~nhanb/mcross) is a minimal and usable
+[gemini://](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) browser written in python and
+tkinter, meaning it Just Works (tm) on any self-respecting desktop OS: Linux,
+Windows, Mac OS, and maybe the BSDs? Never tried one of those.
+
+
+## ORTS
+
+[ORTS](https://github.com/nhanb/orts/) is a GUI for operating scoreboards on
+fighting game streams.
+
+
+## An animated wallpaper for KDE Plasma
+
+I was frustrated that KDE 5 didn&#39;t allow animated gifs as wallpaper so I [wrote
+one][3]. Every now and then someone would [use it on /r/unixporn][4] and cause
+a surge in github stars. It is currently my most starred repo, which gives me
+mixed feelings.
+
+
+## Caophim
+
+[Caophim][5] is my take on imageboard software and also my excuse to try
+[Nim][6]. There&#39;s a usable live instance at [caophim.net][7]. It&#39;s nowhere near
+my goals but to be honest I got tired of [running][8] [into][9] [nim&#39;s][10]
+[bugs][11], in the compiler, the standard library, the flagship module that&#39;s
+supposed to supersede a module in the standard library... you name it. The
+straw that broke the camel&#39;s back though, was [this gem right here][12] that
+remains unfixed to this day.
+
+
+## Unmaintained projects
+
+[**Pytaku**][1] was an online &quot;manga aggregator aggregator&quot;: it let me follow new
+manga scanlation releases on multiple sites. Eventually the limits of Google
+App Engine&#39;s free offering prompted me to do a rewrite which resulted in
+endless yak-shaving and analysis paralysis. Then life happened, _then_
+[tachiyomi][2] happened and I lost the actual need for the project.
