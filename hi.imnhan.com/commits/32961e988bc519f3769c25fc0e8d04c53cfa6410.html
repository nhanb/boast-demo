-# Heey
+I&#39;ve [mentioned][1] before that I&#39;m not a fan of Docker as a deployment
+strategy. In that same post I briefly mentioned that Go could simplify
+deployment compared to Python. Today I&#39;ll _go_ (haha get it?) into detail,
+warts and all, how I recently set up a publicly accessible Go web service,
+backed by a Postgres database, fronted by Caddy which does TLS termination &amp;
+automatic Let&#39;s Encrypt cert renewal, supervised &amp; isolated by systemd.
+
+## Go
+
+If you&#39;re new to Go like me, you may find it helpful to skim the book [Let&#39;s
+Go][2] by Alex Edwards. It demonstrates helpful patterns so you can quickly put
+together a web service with little more than the Go standard library. However,
+it&#39;s cumbersome to define routes using only `net/http`, so I recommend using
+the very minimal [flow][3] routing library written by the same author: it
+offers a cleaner API while having very little code itself. Heck, you should
+probably vendor it and later customize whichever way you want.
+
+As for the PostgreSQL driver, I chose [github.com/lib/pq][4] simply because
+it&#39;s a pure Go library that implements the standard `database/sql` interface.
+I preferred to learn the most common API before branching into more
+special-purpose stuff. It quickly became tedious and error-prone to write all
+that boilerplate for reading data into Go structs though. I heard good things
+about [sqlc][5], which generates Go code from SQL queries. I&#39;ll most likely try
+that next.
+
+Sticking to pure Go code brings 2 big benefits: **independence from glibc** and
+**effortless cross-compilation**.
+
+Not depending on glibc means our compiled executable for, say, Linux, will run,
+not only on any Linux distro regardless of its glibc version, but also on
+distros that use alternative libc implementations e.g. musl. Coming from
+Python, it&#39;s incredibly liberating to no longer have to find an ancient distro
+with the oldest possible glibc to build my executables on (most Python projects
+that do anything useful use C extensions, sadly). It&#39;s not without caveat
+though: some of Go&#39;s own standard libraries, namely `net` and `os/user`, use cgo
+by default. We can set `CGO_ENABLED=0` to avoid that, which tells the Go
+compiler to use their alternative pure Go implementations, but those are not as
+full-featured. If your code or dependency requires those, make sure to check if
+they work correctly with the pure Go version. The easiet way to confirm that
+your compiled executable is truly static is using either `ldd` or `file`:
+
+```sh
+$ ldd mybinary
+#        not a dynamic executable
+
+$ file mybinary | tr , &#39;\n&#39;
+# mybinary: ELF 64-bit LSB executable
+#  x86-64
+#  version 1 (SYSV)
+#  statically linked
+#  Go BuildID=[...]
+#  with debug_info
+#  not stripped
+```
+
+Cross-compilation is self-explanatory: out of the box, you can compile to any
+architecture/OS combination that Go supports. No more looking for the right CI
+service or docker container to build your stuff in.
+
+See also:
+
+- [cgo is not Go][11]—a more exhaustive argument for staying in pure
+  Go-land.
+- [Statically compile Go programs][16]—a deep dive into static Go compilation
+  and its quirks, complete with examples on how to statically link against
+  SQLite with musl libc, if you must.
+
+## Postgres
+
+While SQLite is a fine choice for small-to-medium sites, it does have its own
+quirks: so-called [flexible type checking][6] and [limited ALTER TABLE
+capabilities][7] are my two pet peeves.
+
+Postgres has none of those quirks, but causes extra operational complexity, not
+only for deployment, but also for development: you now need to erect a Postgres
+server with the right db/user/password combination for each project.
+
+From the local development perspective, this is actually one of the few cases
+where Docker rightfully shines: whip up a tiny docker-compose.yml, hit that
+`docker-compose up` command, and you&#39;ve got yourself a nicely isolated,
+delightfully disposable postgres server with your desired user/password/db
+combination, exposed at the exact port you want:
+
+```yaml
+# docker-compose.yml
+version: &#39;3.9&#39;
+services:
+  db:
+    image: postgres:15
+    ports: 127.0.0.1:5432:5432
+    environment:
+      POSTGRES_USER: example
+      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
+      POSTGRES_DB: example
+```
+
+Since a developer&#39;s computer is typically not lacking in resources, we can get
+away with docker&#39;s storage overhead, and, in MacOS&#39;s case, VM overhead.
+
+But what if we want to stick to our anti-docker guns? Good news: it&#39;s still
+possible to have [Per-project Postgres][8] instances. Here&#39;s the gist:
+
+```sh
+cd my-project
+mkdir .pgres # postgres data dir
+
+# These envars tell postgres cli tools to:
+# a) put data files in .pgres
+# b) connect to server via a socket inside .pgres
+export PGDATA=&quot;$PWD/.pgres&quot;
+export PGHOST=&quot;$PWD/.pgres&quot;
+
+initdb # populate .pgres/
+
+echo &quot;listen_addresses = &#39;&#39;&quot; &gt;&gt; .pgres/postgresql.conf
+echo &quot;unix_socket_directories = &#39;$PGHOST&#39;&quot; &gt;&gt; .pgres/postgresql.conf
+
+echo &quot;CREATE DATABASE $USER;&quot; | postgres --single -E postgres
+```
+
+_(I also made a [python script][9] to automate this process)_
+
+Now whenever you develop on this project, just cd into the project dir, make
+sure $PGDATA and $PGHOST point to the correct dir, then run `postgres`. You can
+save those environment variables into a `setenv.sh` script to source every
+time, or use tools like [direnv][10] to automatically set them on cd. When you
+no longer need it, cleaning up is as simple as removing the .pgres dir.
+
+On the server side, if you&#39;re on, say, Debian, the Postgres developers maintain
+an [Apt repo][13] that provides any currently supported version of Postgres, so
+you can always use the latest and greatest DB while still enjoying the
+stability of Debian. Just follow the instructions to add the repo, install your
+preferred postgres version, then enable &amp; start the postgresql service using
+`systemctl`.
+
+You&#39;ll then need to follow the distro&#39;s [convention][12] to create a DB with
+its dedicated username/password combination. Here&#39;s how I set up mine:
+
+```sh
+$ su - postgres
+(as postgres) $ createuser --pwprompt mypguser
+(as postgres) $ createdb -O mypguser mypgdatabase
+```
+
+I didn&#39;t bother to create a dedicated OS user, because I&#39;ll later use systemd&#39;s
+DynamicUser feature to run my service on its own dynamically created user
+anyway. This brings us to...
+
+## systemd
+
+Inevitably you&#39;ll need something to manage your service process: autostart on
+boot, report/restart when it goes down, piping logs to the right place, that
+sort of thing. People used to install things like [supervisord][14] for that.
+(Docker Compose would kinda work too, but we&#39;re trying to see if we can avoid
+gratuitous container usage here, remember?)
+
+Nowadays though, systemd is already pervasive in mainstream Linux distros, and
+comes tightly integrated with supporting services e.g. journald, so it makes
+little sense to use anything else for service management.
+
+To limit the blast radius if (when?) a service gets pwn&#39;ed, it&#39;s recommended to
+run each service as its own OS user that only has access to what it actually
+needs. In the past I used to create 1 system user to run each service as, but
+this time I realized I could use systemd&#39;s [DynamicUser][15] instead:
+
+```ini
+# /etc/systemd/system/myservice.service
+[Service]
+ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/myservice
+Environment=MYSERVICE_DB=postgres://db-user:db-password@localhost/db-name
+Environment=MYSERVICE_ADDR=localhost:8000
+DynamicUser=1
+Restart=always
+
+[Install]
+WantedBy=multi-user.target
+```
+
+It&#39;s just a little less work compared to creating a system user with the
+correct restrictions and running the service under that user, but hey, less
+work is less work! Also that&#39;s one fewer thing that I have to worry about
+messing up.
+
+You may have noticed the `ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/myservice` line, which
+assumes my service&#39;s executable is in /usr/local/bin/. Since my service is only
+1 binary with no support files, this, and postgres credentials (provided via
+the `MYSERVICE_DB` envar), are all that&#39;s needed to run the service. It also
+means for subsequent deployments, this will be my entire deployment procedure:
+
+```sh
+# compile:
+CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o dist/myservice
+# copy binary to server (scp works too):
+rsync -av dist/myservice myserver:/usr/local/bin/myservice
+# restart service:
+ssh myserver systemctl restart myservice
+```
+
+## Caddy
+
+Nowadays I prefer [Caddy][17] as the TLS-terminating reverse proxy instead of
+nginx, since it transparently performs Let&#39;s Encrypt&#39;s ACME challenge behind
+the scene. With my web service listening at localhost:8000, it literally takes
+2 lines of config to:
+
+- Serve HTTPS at port 443, with a valid cert provided by Let&#39;s Encrypt, using
+  reasonable default cryptographic settings—I just ran my site through the
+  [ssllabs.com test][18] and it handily scored an A.
+- Serve HTTP at port 80 that simply redirects to the HTTPS port
+
+```nginx
+# /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
+my-domain.com {
+    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
+}
+```
+
+There are many interesting problems to solve when running a web service, and
+HTTPS cert bookkeeping is not one of them, so I&#39;m more than happy to stop
+fiddling with certbot cron jobs.
+
+## Closing remarks
+
+For a proper production-grade service, there&#39;s more to be done:
+personally I&#39;m using `ufw` to lock down everything except for the HTTP(S) ports
+and wireguard (I&#39;m doing ssh over wireguard only too). Enabling unattended
+upgrades is also a good idea. But of course these depend heavily on each
+person&#39;s requirements and tastes.
+
+Of course I&#39;m not advocating for manual &quot;pet&quot; server maintenance everywhere.
+Nothing from this setup prevents you from doing proper automated provisioning,
+configuration management, so on and so forth. In fact, it is easier to e.g.
+write an ansible playbook for this setup, because it&#39;s simpler: you don&#39;t have
+to worry about setting up the correct python virtual environment, or making
+nginx and certbot play well with each other. Hell, you can dockerize parts of
+this setup, and your Dockerfiles will be simpler thanks to it. I&#39;ve [said it
+before][1], and I&#39;ll say it again:
+
+&gt; Throwing abstractions over complex procedures is simply shifting the costs
+&gt; elsewhere. Shipping your software in a Dockerfile is fine, but making your
+&gt; distribution so simple that people can easily write a couple of lines of
+&gt; Dockerfile for it by themselves is more valuable. Simple distribution is
+&gt; simple to deploy regardless of whether you&#39;re using docker, packer, ansible,
+&gt; pyinfra, podman, nomad, k8s, k3s, an impenetrable shell script some dude
+&gt; wrote 2 years ago who just left the company last month... or any combination
+&gt; of the above. The point is **you shouldn&#39;t be forced to use more heavyweight
+&gt; solutions just because the software is a pain in the butt to setup
+&gt; manually**.
+
+Sooner or later we&#39;ll all have to peek under the hood to diagnose problems, and
+the fewer moving pieces you have to learn and understand, the more grateful
+you&#39;ll be to your predecessors (and, let&#39;s be honest, the fewer profanities
+you&#39;ll have to utter to yourself).
