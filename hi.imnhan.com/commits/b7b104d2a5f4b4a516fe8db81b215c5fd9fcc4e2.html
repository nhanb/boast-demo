 ![My face](/images/nhan.jpg)
 
-My name is **Bùi Thành Nhân**. I&#39;m an undergraduate at RMIT Vietnam, focusing myself on web
-development, mostly backend but I&#39;m also taking huge interests in frontend frameworks (twitter
-bootstrap, knockoutjs, etc.).
-
-I have a working knowledge of Java desktop programming, experience on web programming with PHP and
-setting up simple LAMP stacks. My current interests are python as a web backend language (Google
-App Engine anyone?) and tinkering with frontend frameworks.
-
-I usually go with the handle **nhanb** on most social networks, you can find links to my profiles
-on the sidebar. In my free time I enjoy tinkering with shell scripts (sometimes pythons scripts
-too) to try out ways to improve productivity. When I&#39;m not being a nerd, you can find me attempting
-to produce something passable as music with my guitar.
