 **TL;DR:** bright crisp screen, acceptable keyboard, thin &amp; light build, buggy
-touchpad even on ChromeOS, almost usable on MrChromebox UEFI + Arch Linux
-except for the fact that sound crashes most of the time. It&#39;s absolutely not
-worth the sticker price at [$1,099.99][1] (lol). Maybe consider buying if you can
-find it at a heavy discount and the Linux sound issue has been fixed somehow.

 ## Context
 
-Sometime in 2022 I was looking for a replacement for my T530---something
-lighter with a better screen---and saw a listing for a used Acer Chromebook
-Spin 713-3W at only 10mil VND ($425, give or take). A recently released HiDPI
-laptop with an i5-1135G7 at 425 freedom dollars? And I get to play with
-ChromeOS/Crostini on a not-pathetically-weak x86 device? Sign me right up, I
-thought. The plan was to run ChromeOS/Android apps for GUI stuff, and install
-my usual tmux+vim based development [environment][2] on Crostini.

+- Specs: i5-1135G7 (Tiger Lake), Xe graphics, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD
+- Keyboard: acceptable
+- Screen: 2256x1504 (3:2) at 13.5&quot; (200dpi). Subjectively speaking, it&#39;s
+  bright, colorful and delivers crisp text---I have nothing but praise here.
+- Speakers: worse and quieter than my Samsung Tab S8 tablet

 ## ChromeOS/Crostini
 
-As advertised, the laptop can run ChromeOS apps, Android apps, and Linux apps
-via containers. By default I got a Debian container, but since I need
+&gt; I&#39;d just like to interject for a moment. What you&#39;re referring to as Linux,
+&gt; is in fact, CHROME/Linux, or as I&#39;ve recently taken to calling it, CHROME
+&gt; plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another
+&gt; free component of a fully functioning CHROME system made useful by the CHROME
+&gt; v8, css utililties, and other vital system components comprising a full OS as
+&gt; defined by the W3C.

+As advertised, the laptop could run ChromeOS apps, Android apps, and Linux apps

 up-to-date software for development, I set up an Arch container instead. [The
 process][3] itself was straightforward enough.

 managed to wrangle traffic correctly for programs running inside Crostini too!
 The only hiccup was that Magic DNS didn&#39;t work, so I needed to put the
 hostname-IP pairs into /etc/hosts manually. I also had to change the temp dir
-from /tmp to ~/tmp for golang tools to work, because Crostini programs weren&#39;t

+from /tmp to ~/tmp for [Go][4] tools to work, because Crostini programs weren&#39;t
+allowed to exec files inside /tmp. Once I&#39;d worked out those kinks, I could
+open up a terminal and start working as if I were on one of my Arch PCs. Hell,
+even docker/docker-compose Just Worked™ inside the container.
+
+But then came the papercuts.
+
+The touchpad would randomly lag, as in, dragging still
+worked but there was a noticeable delay between my dragging and seeing the
+cursor actually moving. The problem would just go away as randomly as it
+happened.
+
+Back when I used an actual Linux machine, I was used to having 10 virtual
+desktops, numbered from 1 to 10, with Alt-n mapped to &quot;jump to desktop #n&quot;, and
+Windows-n mapped to &quot;move window to desktop #n&quot; (the `0` key maps to
+desktop #10, naturally). While ChromeOS has a &quot;workspaces&quot; feature, there&#39;s no
+way to navigate and juggle windows between them precisely and instantly.
+_Instantly_ is an important keyword here: many tasks, while doable, suffered
+from gratuitous animations and tedious step-by-step navigation. This reminded
+me of when I tried to use a Macbook professionally: things kinda worked, but
+the experience would always be intrinsically worse.
+
+While Linux GUI programs were automagically put on the ChromeOS applications
+list as first class citizens, certain quality-of-life features didn&#39;t work. For
+example, on KDE I used to be able to drag a video streaming link from the
+browser onto MPV&#39;s taskbar icon [to play it][5]. This no longer worked on
+ChromeOS.
+
+So I jumped ship.
+
+## Real Arch Linux on MrChromebox UEFI
+
+Installing _real_ Linux on this device requires installing the MrChromebox
+custom UEFI firmware, which in turn requires disabling the firmware write
+protection. Fortunately, for this device all I needed to do was opening up the
+laptop and [disconnecting the battery][7]:
+
+![internals](/images/voxel_internals.jpg)
+
+![battery-connector](/images/voxel_battery.jpg)
+
+If you need more detailed instructions, here&#39;s the [official manual][8].
+
+Then go [here][9] for instructions on how to download and run the MrChromebox
+utility script. In my case, I also needed to enable developer mode to get
+access to the chrosh shell.
+
+After this I got a normal UEFI boot menu so I could pop in an Arch installer
+USB drive and carried out the installation as usual.
+
+I managed to install KDE plasma and everything worked except for audio: the
+usual &quot;default&quot; audio profile wouldn&#39;t show up, even after I installed the
+necessary packages: `sof-firmware` (sound firmware for recent Intel
+generations) and `alsa-ucm-conf` (so-called topologies for these newer
+devices). After some desperate googling I found
+&lt;https://github.com/eupnea-linux/audio-scripts&gt; which installed some missing
+configs lifted straight from ChromeOS upstream. Sure enough, the device showed
+up:
+
+![default-profile-get](/images/voxel_audio_device.png)
+
+And it would actually play sound... for a while until it crashes.
+
+I collected logs and tried googling but nothing comes up that matches my case.
+Asking in the eupnea discord server yielded an uncertain response:
+
+&gt; looks like yet again intel broke something
+
+Oh, and the random touchpad delay issue was still there, so I&#39;m starting to
+think the touchpad hardware itself is problematic.
+
+And that&#39;s where I&#39;m at. I&#39;ll probably gather more logs and submit an issue to
+the SOF project. For now, consider this a warning: the laptop as of now is
+probably not worth buying. Hell, in Vietnam you can get a second hand X1 Carbon
+6th gen with an i7-8650U and 16GB of RAM for $460 right now from
+&lt;https://chotot.com&gt;; that&#39;s a guaranteed best-in-class keyboard, decent
+screen and Linux compatibility, at just a slight decrease in performance.
+
+But hey, I would have never known any of this if I hadn&#39;t tried, right?
