+Title: What I did after installing Manjaro xfce
+Slug: what-i-did-after-installing-manjaro-xfce
+Date: 2014-02-04 20:20:13
+
+After about 2 months with elementary OS, I got sick of the guaranteed once-every-hour crashes of
+its **Files** file manager (yeah, I&#39;m still hating their naming decisions with a passion), the
+flickering when I play fullscreen OpenGL games, and the automatic collapsing of workspaces. I&#39;ve
+had enough of that. Let&#39;s go back to xfce! But hey, (X)ubuntu 14.04 is nearly out but I don&#39;t want
+to install an alpha version right now, and installing 13.10 just to update 2 months later is insane
+(to me, at least). That&#39;s when I noticed Manjaro - a battery-included distro based on Arch. All
+hail rolling release!
+
+Although Manjaro comes packed with most of the apps that I would install on any other distro
+anyway: GIMP, LibreOffice, Steam, etc., here are some additional steps I took to make it rock.
+
+## Get Mirosoft fonts
+
+Getting Micro$oft fonts is like the first thing to do after any Linux distro installation. The Arch
+community has a whole [wiki page][1] dedicated to it. It&#39;s worth mentioning that you can&#39;t
+*legally* install those packages without the actual fonts already on your computer. Assuming you
+have an installed copy of Windows 7, go to its `Fonts` folder and put the necessary fonts in the
+same folder of the extracted package downloaded from the AUR page. For some instant copy-and-paste
+commands: (**warning**: this script assumes you already have all your Windows 7 fonts in
+`~/win_fonts/`. Put them there before running the following commands)
+
+    :::bash
+    curl -O &#39;https://gist.github.com/nhanb/8804875/raw/arch-ms-fonts.sh&#39;
+    bash arch-ms-fonts.sh
