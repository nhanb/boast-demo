+Title: Opening http link under the cursor in vim
+Date: 2021-08-07 11:37
+
+Internet&#39;s wise old chatty uncle [Walter Bright](https://www.walterbright.com/)
+recently [commented](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28090272) on Hacker
+News:
+
+&gt; [...]
+&gt;
+&gt; Ever since the Intel CPU spec went online, I started doing this with the code
+&gt; generator - providing links to the man page for the instruction being used:
+&gt;
+&gt; &lt;https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/src/dmd/cparse.d#L591&gt;
+&gt;
+&gt; And for bug fixes, reference the issue which often gives a detailed
+&gt; explanation for why the code is a certain way:
+&gt;
+&gt; &lt;https://github.com/dlang/dmd/blob/master/src/dmd/backend/cgxmm.d#L1210&gt;
+&gt;
+&gt; Ever since I enhanced the editor I use to open the browser on links, this
+&gt; sort of thing has proven to be very, very handy.
+
+I&#39;ve never had any issue with opening links from vim: I have `&lt;leader&gt;y` set up
+in Visual mode to yank stuff into the system-wide clipboard which I can then
+paste into the browser. However, ever since I mapped `&lt;leader&gt;gh` to trigger
+[`:GBrowse`][1] that opens a browser tab instantly, the old &quot;select &gt; copy &gt;
+switch to browser &gt; Ctrl+T &gt; Ctrl+V&quot; flow started to feel... prehistoric. Mr.
+Bright&#39;s comment gave me the final nudge to actually go ahead and set it up.
+
+The good folks from the [developer encyclopedia][3] suggested `gx` but for some
+reason, setting `g:netrw_browsex_viewer` [didn&#39;t seem to do anything][4] so the
+command would always `wget` the link then tell the browser to open that
+downloaded file. Therefore, I cobbled together this snippet which was adapted
+from those stackoverflow &amp; github threads:
+
+```vimscript
+function! OpenURL()
+  let l:url = matchstr(expand(&quot;&lt;cWORD&gt;&quot;), &#39;https\=:\/\/[^ &gt;,;()]*&#39;)
+  if l:url != &quot;&quot;
+    let l:url = shellescape(l:url, 1)
+    let l:command = &quot;!xdg-open &quot;.l:url
+    echo l:command
+    silent exec l:command
+  else
+    echo &quot;No URL found under cursor.&quot;
+  endif
+endfunction
+
+nnoremap gl :call OpenURL()&lt;cr&gt;
+```
+
+_(if you&#39;re on a Mac, replacing `xdg-open` with `open` will probably
+do the same thing)_
+
+Now whenever I have my cursor on an http(s) url, I can type `gl` from normal
+mode and xdg-open will use my default browser to open it up. This could be
+extended to any other scheme like `mailto` or `ftp` but I don&#39;t have any
+practical use for them right now so that will do.
+
+One drawback is if there&#39;s a whitespace in the URL (which is bad practice
+anyway), my regex won&#39;t match the whole thing. In such cases I&#39;d rather resort
+to good old manual visual mode than try to be clever and make my URL detecting
+logic exponentially more complex. I&#39;d take simple software with obvious, easily
+understood behavior over overcomplicated, (possibly) subtly broken balls of mud
+any day.
+
+By the way, if you looked at my script and got spooked by the idea of executing
+a shell command composed from arbitrary, potentially unsafe input (i.e. text
+file content), don&#39;t worry: that&#39;s what [`shellescape()`][2] is for.
