 But hey, I would have never known any of this if I hadn&#39;t tried, right?
 
+## Aside: Chromebook keyboard quirks on KDE

+The most glaring issue is the absence of the `windows` key (aka `super`,
+`hyper`, or `meta`). It&#39;s not a huge problem for me: I always make `capslock`
+act as a `ctrl` key, so I can turn the original `ctrl` into `windows` instead:

+![changed-modifier-keys](/images/voxel_keys_mod.jpg)
+
+Another problem is that the F1-12 keys are not usable: they are [mapped to
+function keys][10] in MrChromebox UEFI firmware, and there&#39;s no modifier to use
+them as F-keys either. That means no F11 to toggle fullscreen, no Alt-F4, no F9
+to toggle drop-down terminal, etc. Fortunately such global shortcuts can be
+configured trivially from KDE&#39;s system preferences. On the other hand,
+application-specific features that are hardwired to use F-keys are simply
+unreachable: `htop` is one such example.
