+Title: Why I use Linux - Automation
+Date: 2013-06-07 08:02
+Category: tutorials
+Tags: python, linux
+Slug: why-i-use-linux-automation
+Summary: Repeating is boring
+
+(In this post, when I say Linux, I mean any popular GNU/Linux distribution. Hope this clarification
+will keep the nitpickers away.)
+
+First let&#39;s discuss *why* automation rocks.
+
+# Repetition is evil (and boring)
+
+As a (would-be) software engineer, the *repetition is evil* notion has been planted in my head for
+far more times than anything else, and for good reasons.
+
+People are far more prone to error than computers, and doing repetitive tasks creates just too
+much room for that. Computers, on the other hand, do everything exactly how you tell them to do,
+with extreme speed and accuracy.
+
+Moreover, let&#39;s face it: We developers are all (or at least mostly) lazy. Not the &quot;I&#39;m don&#39;t
+wanna do anything&quot; kind of lazy, but more of the &quot;This crap is boring and not challenging at all,
+why the hell am I wasting time for it?&quot; type. We&#39;ve all got better things to do with our lives,
+like re-watching the last episode of BBC&#39;s *Sherlock* to look for clues to how he faked his death,
+or trying to figure out what that &quot;Han shot first&quot; meme means (sorry, I&#39;m from the later
+generation).
+
+# Automation needs command line tools
+
+Because, of course, GUI programs are (nearly) impossible to interact with in our scripts. Sure
+you can try mouse click emulation tools and stuff like that, but is it really worth the effort?
+And I&#39;d bet anything that those tools are far from reliable (GUI latency, anyone?).
+
+And this is where Windows falls short. Most (if not all) Windows tools are designed for GUI, and
+the whole Windows ecosystem is built around GUI use.
+
+It&#39;s a whole different matter in Linux: from the good old awk, sed, grep, wget to the new shiny
+aria2... Almost anything you can think of is available as a command line tool.
+
+# Putting them all together
+
+Just like any UNIX-like system, Linux tools utilize the One True Phylosophy: Do only 1 thing, and
+do it well. (okay, I&#39;m paraphrasing a bit, but you get the idea)
+
+The true power of command line tools is when they are used together. Let&#39;s take a look at a
+[python script](https://gist.github.com/nhanb/5726342) I wrote last night to download the whole
+beginner course from [justinguitar](http://www.justinguitar.com).
+
+The real flow starts from line 48:
+
+    :::python
+    # Fetch index pages which has links to all beginner lessons
+    r = requests.get(&#39;http://www.justinguitar.com/en/BC-000-BeginnersCourse.php&#39;)
+    start_page = r.text
+
+    # Search for all links to lessons
+    pat = re.compile(&#39;&lt;a href=&quot;(BC-[0-9]{3}-.+?)&quot;&#39;)
+    pages = pat.findall(start_page)
+
+    # Fetch html for each lesson
+    pages_html = fetch_html(pages)
+
+    # Crawl each lesson page, pull out lesson names and youtube link code
+    youtube_codes = []
+    for html in pages_html:
+        code = parse_info(html)
+        print code
+        if code not in youtube_codes:
+            youtube_codes.append(code)
+
+To summarize, this snippet goes to justinguitar&#39;s beginner course index page, grab all links to
+each lesson, then grab the lesson title as well as the youtube video code to its video. The
+result is the list name `youtube_codes`; each element is a tuple with the format
+`(title, youtube_code)`.
+
+Then I use a command line tool called `youtube-dl` to fetch the direct link to each video. The
+tool itself can download the video too, but it doesn&#39;t support multiple connections to
+accelerate the download. This is where `aria2c` jumps in: it takes the direct link from
+`youtube-dl` then download the whole thing:
+
+    :::python
+    # Leech the hell out of them
+    for lesson in youtube_codes:
+
+        # Ignore if lesson has no video
+        if lesson[1] == None:
+            call([&#39;touch&#39;, lesson[0]])
+            continue
+
+        # Use youtube-dl to get fresh download link and file extension
+        command = &#39;youtube-dl &#39; + lesson[1] +\
+                &#39; --skip-download --get-url --get-filename -f 35/34/82/44/43/100&#39;
+
+        shell_output = str(check_output(command.split()))
+        direct_link, fname = shell_output.splitlines()
+        file_ext = fname[fname.rfind(&#39;.&#39;):]
+        file_name = lesson[0] + file_ext
+
+        # Then aria2 for serious multi-part download acceleration
+        print &#39;Downloading &#39; + file_name + &#39;...&#39;
+        command = [&#39;aria2c&#39;, &quot;-o&quot;, file_name, &#39;-x2&#39;,
+                &quot;%s&quot; % direct_link]
+        shell_output = check_output(command)
+        print shell_output
+
+That&#39;s it! I just needed to launch this script, turn off the laptop screen and go to bed. This
+morning I woke up seeing the whole course with almost 200 lessons downloaded. Imagine having to
+manually download all that by clicking each link... You don&#39;t wanna go there, do you?
+
+So that&#39;s just a very simple example of what automation helps your every day life. Of course its
+true power is unleashed when used in development; this is how one-click test and deployment
+works. Windows can do this too, but your choice of tool will be limited. And don&#39;t get me started
+on its lack of a decent package manager!
+
+To make a long story short, do yourself a favor and install a Linux distro.
+
+... or buy a Mac.
