+Title: &quot;Have you built anything cool?&quot;
+Slug: have-you-built-anything-cool
+Date: 2013-12-04 08:55:44
+Status: draft
+
+So yesterday I went to a *networking event* - something I have never liked or been good at. I&#39;m
+not sure if I&#39;m one of those introverts or if I&#39;m just socially awkward, but the very idea of
+going around trying to converse with total strangers just to exchange business cards is not at all
+appealing to me. Anyway, that&#39;s another story. Right now I want to write about something a guy
+from a non-tech company asked me:
+
+&gt; \- Have you built anything cool?  
+&gt; \- [pause] Well, more or less...  
+&gt; \- What do you mean by &quot;more or less&quot;? [...] Have you built anything at all?  
+
+Then I went on trying to explain what my recent side project - 
+[pytaku](https://pytaku.appspot.com) - does and why it is awesome for me. He seemed to be
+disinterested halfway through so I decided to shut up anyway.
+
+Sure, I have done stuff every now and then, be it assignment work or something I decided to create
+for my own amusement. It is just funny how I have already stepped into to my final year without
+taking a proper look back at what I have done in these past 2 years, so I&#39;m going to do just that.
+
+If you - Nicholas - are reading this and don&#39;t want all the nerdy stuff, here are my condensed
+answers:
+
+### Have you built anything?  
+Yes, I have done desktop and Android games, a movie ticket sales program, a desktop manga
+grabber, a web version of it that talks to dropbox, and several small shell scripts / web
+utilities.  
+
+### So, nothing cool?  
+If you&#39;re neither a tech geek nor an otaku (which I assume you&#39;re probably not) then no,
+there&#39;s probably nothing I&#39;ve done that you would find interesting.
+
+## First year - Welcome to the web, and the GUI programming disillusionment
+
+I had touched *web stuff* before in high school: a vBulletin forum that I created (unofficially)
+for students in my middle school. However, I only properly learned PHP and JS when I started the
+Web Programming course here. With (moderately) great power came great desires, so I set out to
+build a basic PHP site to scrape a view page&#39;s HTML to get direct video links (not working anymore
+since a recent youtube update)
+
+![tubegrab v2.9](/images/tubegrab.jpg &quot;tubegrab v2.9&quot;)
+
+That was my first touch on jQueryUI and regular expressions; I also learned how RMIT&#39;s mekong
+server sucked to the point that it didn&#39;t allow `get_file_contents()`.
+
+I also learned about MVC and GUI programming with Java swing.
