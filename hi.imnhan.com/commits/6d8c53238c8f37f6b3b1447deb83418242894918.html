+Title: I did NOT sign that online petition!
+Slug: i-did-not-sign-that-rmit-sc-petition
+Date: 2016-03-12 01:13
+
+This evening I received a rather strange email:
+
+![](/images/rmitsc_01_wtf.png)
+
+Um... I don&#39;t remember signing any petition recently (or ever, for that matter)?
+
+## What happened?
+
+Apparently someone used my RMIT student email address to sign some petition for disbanding the
+university&#39;s Student Council. Said petition was apparently started by the Ms. Trần Ngọc Tuệ Mẫn -
+Student Council&#39;s vice president. Well... yay for free speech, I guess? Anyway, my name was really
+among signers list:
+
+![](/images/rmitsc_02_names.png)
+
+How did this happen? Well, turns out **iPetition does not require email confirmation upon
+signing**, so anyone can effectively enter any email and name they want and the stupid website will
+happily accept that as an absolutely definitely most positively legit supporter of your cause. Cool
+huh?
+
+Upon further inspection, almost all of the signer names are in one same format: the one that RMIT
+uses for its student names. So apparently a very motivated supporter of Ms. Mẫn&#39;s... interesting
+campaign has been helpful enough to go through RMIT students&#39; IDs and names and sign us up, without
+us even having to know what it&#39;s all about. Gee, thanks!
+
+## Why do I even care?
+
+I just don&#39;t like people using my name without my consent. Also I thought this could be a somewhat
+useful public service announcement. I don&#39;t know.
+
+Hell, let&#39;s throw in some of my own random thoughts to make this more like a blog post:
+
+- What&#39;s with these petition websites? Have people actually achieved anything using these? Even if
+  a petition website does send confirmation emails, what&#39;s stopping me from using trash addresses?
+  The signers&#39; email addresses are not displayed anyway so president@rmit.edu.vn won&#39;t be too
+  different from spammemaybelolwhut0042@nerdyweekly.com now, will it?
+
+- The number of signers keep going up steadily, but slowly. Maybe our friendly neighborhood
+  petition mass signer is doing it all by hand instead of a script? If it&#39;s the former... let&#39;s say
+  I do admire the dedication.
+
+- Is it normal for a student council to be this full of drama?
+
+That concludes my mostly pointless blog post. Hopefully I&#39;ll come up with something actually worth
+sharing soon. Until then, have an awesome weekend!
