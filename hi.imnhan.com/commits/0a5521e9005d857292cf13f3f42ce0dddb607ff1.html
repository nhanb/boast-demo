 ![My face](/images/nhan.jpg)
 
-My name is **Bùi Thành Nhân**. I&#39;m a Vietnamese software developer with a keen interest in DevOps.
-
-When I&#39;m not working, I tend to lurk around GitHub, go swimming, or try to [literally gamify][5] my
-excercise plan (with questionable results). I also recently got into [fighting games][7].  Give me
-a shout if you&#39;re in Hồ Chí Minh City and would like some Street Fighter or Guilty Gear action!
+Hi, I&#39;m Nhân. I make web&lt;strike&gt;shit&lt;/strike&gt;stuff for a living.
 
 ## About this blog
 
 My mind is a sad mess that cannot hold much information after a couple of
-months or so. This blog is where I write down interesting things I discover. On occasional bad days
-I might throw all my ramblings here too, but hopefully those will be rare.

-I always appreciate feedback and further discussion on my posts, so feel free to point out if you
-think I said something stupid. :)
+I make a point not to include 3rd-party javascript on the page, with the
+exception of [Disqus][3], which is not loaded by default - you&#39;ll need to
+explicitly click on the &quot;show comments&quot; button below each post if you want to
+view or write comments. I think that&#39;s a reasonable compromise.
