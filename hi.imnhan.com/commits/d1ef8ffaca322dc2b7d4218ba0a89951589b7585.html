+Title: The video streaming finale, or why put.io is awesome
+Date: 2020-10-21 11:45
+
+
+[Previously](/posts/streaming-videos-from-google-drive-a-second-attempt/),
+[previously](/posts/towards-an-acceptable-video-playing-experience/).
+
+
+I ditched the whole self hosted mess and just bought a [put.io](https://put.io)
+subscription instead. This has become the smoothest, most no-nonsense video
+streaming experience I&#39;ve ever had.
+
+It transcodes.
+
+It streams.
+
+It has a web-based video player that lets me pick subtitles.
+
+In cases when the subtitles aren&#39;t recognized, or I want to switch between
+audio tracks, I can always drag-n-drop the original file&#39;s streaming URL from
+browser to an mpv launcher like this:
+
+&lt;video controls&gt;
+  &lt;source src=&quot;/images/put.io_01_mpv.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;
+&lt;/video&gt;
+
+
+It also has a third-party Android app that lets me browse and stream via
+mpv-android.
+
+The above is only possible because put.io exposes a powerful, well-documented
+API for everyone to play with.
+
+The web player is clean, snappy (see that, Google Drive team?) and has
+autoplay disabled by default (screw you, Netflix).
+
+It&#39;s refreshing to find software that works _for_ instead of _against_ its
+users these days.
