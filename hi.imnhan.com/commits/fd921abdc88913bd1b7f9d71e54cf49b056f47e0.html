 to wrote my own method that extended the thing to detect more DEs, but soon after that I thought
 &quot;What the hell, why do I even have to do this?&quot; and decided that Swing was dead to me (or any
 desktop Linux user for that matter).
+
+## Second and third year: enough of this &lt;del&gt;bull&lt;/del&gt; school crap. I&#39;m making stuff for myself!
+
+To be fair, the next 2 years have offered a number of new stuff: C/C++ programming, a taste of the
+M$ .NET C# stack (still impressed by Visual Studio&#39;s vi mode plugin), more Java,
+[Android app programming](http://truongtx.me/2013/05/02/agent-069-game/), and some neat security
+tricks. However, none of those intrigued me much, so I decided to start making things for my own:
+
+### Shell scripts
+
+If you have taken a look at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles), you&#39;ll notice that I
+do write a bunch of shell scripts to automate stuff I do often. The one I&#39;m currently proudest of
+is [rmiproxy_silent](https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/rmitproxy_silent), a
+script that automatically dectects whether I am using RMIT&#39;s network and set/clear the appropriate
+proxy settings. Another one that I can&#39;t live without is
+[install.sh](https://github.com/nhanb/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh), a script that helps install
+all my dotfiles, sets up zsh and various things. It saved me *a lot* of time whenever I reinstall
+my system.
+
+Obligatory mention of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/), greatest invention
+since sliced bread!
+
+### AJMG, then Pytaku, then... who knows?
+
+The original idea was actually creating a Java Swing program that helps download manga. It was born
+out of spite of [DomDomSoft](http://blog.domdomsoft.com/), a manga downloader that requires
+&quot;donation&quot; to unlock full functionalities. &quot;I could do that, and I&#39;ll open source the crap out of
+it, because open source is awesome&quot;, I thought. Spent some time and got the minimal program
+working program:
+
+![](/images/ajmg.png)
+
+This program did help me get a firm knowledge of java&#39;s thread manipulation and using http proxy
+(so I could exploit RMIT&#39;s awesome network bandwidth). I also succeeded in achieving separation of
+concern to a certain level this time, allowing contributors (if any) to easily add support for
+other manga reader sites. But then again, Swing&#39;s quirks put me off, so my bad habit of losing
+interest quickly kicked in and the project stopped there.
+
+Then came [Pytaku](https://pytaku-legacy.appspot.com), ajmg&#39;s spiritual successor. At this point I
+knew enough of python and wanted to try out Google App Engine, so I decided to make a web version
+of AJMG, with the difference that instead of downloading directly, it forwards it to the user&#39;s
+Dropbox folder. Why not Google Drive you ask? Because they haven&#39;t even bothered to release an
+official Linux client for it. Shame on you, Google!
+
+Loads of exciting things were learned along the way: how URL handling works in
+webapp2 and in other web frameworks in general, proper templating (can&#39;t believe I ever wrote
+`&lt;?php echo $title; ?&gt;`... not cool!), OAuth2 (more than a few &quot;Aha!&quot; moments working with this
+little guy...), Google&#39;s Datastore and NoSQL ingeneral, and of course, Twitter Bootstrap - saving
+clueless non-designer developers since its inception.
+
+And now, I&#39;m rewriting it from scratch, this time trying out TDD, making use of
+[travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/nhanb/pytaku), which will be especially helpful to periodically
+test if a manga site has changed its page layout and screwed up Pytaku&#39;s scraping code. Have
+encountered a number of quirks when trying to set up the correct testing boilerplate for a Google
+App Engine project, but it seems everything will be smooth from now on. This holiday season I plan
+to at least roll out an alpha version for testing. Stay tuned if you&#39;re interested!
+
+## To sum it up...
+
+I don&#39;t believe in developing products I myself don&#39;t want to use. I want to make things that make
+my life easier, and if that helps others too then it&#39;s a huge bonus. This is why Github is my
+favorite company right now, and
+[How GitHub uses GitHub to build GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyz3jkOBbQY) remains the
+best developer speech I have ever seen.
+
+Right now I haven&#39;t made a full-blown program that I can confidently distribute to end users, but I
+certainly have made quite a few nifty tools to improve my day-to-day computing tasks and learned a
+lot along the way. Right now I cannot confidently answer this big question by pointing them to a
+polished website detailing every nook and cranny of my shiny widely-used, battle-tested program,
+but I&#39;m confident I have the right knowledge to get there. If there is such a thing as &quot;Lunar New
+Year Resolution&quot;, I guess mine is that one year from now, I will have a satisfying answer to this
+question. Watch out world, I&#39;m coming!
+
+So, have *you* built anything cool recently?
