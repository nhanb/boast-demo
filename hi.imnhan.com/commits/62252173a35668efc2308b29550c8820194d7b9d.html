+are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slagcoin.com/&quot;&gt;Slagcoin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.shoryuken.com/categories/tech-talk&quot;&gt;Shoryuken Tech Talk&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/example2.html&quot;&gt;basic
+design&lt;/a&gt; on Slagcoin:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/example2/simple1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

+&lt;h2&gt;Materials and tools&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;If you live in Hồ Chí Minh City like me, you can probably get everything you need from shops on
+Bạch Đằng Street. The only hard part for me was convincing a small wood shop to sell MDF panels cut
+to my specifications in small quantity:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;ul&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+4 pieces x 30cm x 20cm x 1cm *
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+2 pieces x 20cm x 4cm x 2cm
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+2 pieces x 20cm x 7cm x 2cm
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+1 piece x 26cm x 4cm x 2cm
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;li&gt;
+4 pieces x 34cm x 7cm x 2cm *
+&lt;/li&gt;
+&lt;/ul&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;All that set me back 120,000 VND. The cost was mostly for cutting labor instead of actual material.
+The items with asterisks (*) are those I bought in abundance to make room for drilling errors.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_01_mdf.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The top panel would be layered with 1 MDF and 2 plexiglass pieces (mad illustrating skillz, I
+know):&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_02_top_plan.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The bottom would simply be 1 MDF and 1 plexiglass so I could also insert bottom artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Since I had zero woodworking experience, I joined the MDF pieces with simple butt joints and good
+old wood glue. You’ll notice that there’s a significant gap on one corner - turns out the shop
+wasn’t too accurate with their cutting. It’s not shown here but eventually I had to saw a longer
+MDF piece to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_03_glue.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;I already had a hand drill laying around so all it took was buying a couple of hole saws - 24mm and
+30mm in diameter respectively. The bigger one was used for drilling main button holes while the
+other was for joystick hole and smaller front side buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_04_hole_saw.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t buy&lt;/em&gt; hole saws like the one below - you will not be able to drill through thick panels
+(like the 20mm thick one I bought):&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_05_nope_saw.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;As for the actual parts, I ordered the joystick and buttons from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.akishop.jp/&quot;&gt;Akishop&lt;/a&gt;. It ships from
+Japan so the shipping cost to Vietnam is much more reasonable than if I buy from the US. I also
+bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ebay.com/itm/Zero-Delay-USB-Encoder-to-PC-Joystick-For-Arcade-DIY-KIT-Sanwa-Parts-MAME-/191558265304?hash=item2c99c329d8#shpCntId&quot;&gt;Zero Delay PCB kit&lt;/a&gt; from ebay. This one even offers free shipping since it’s from
+China. This kit offers easy solder-free wires too so it saved me from a lot of trouble (I still
+can’t find where to quick-disconnect terminals to this date). I connected everything to my PC to
+test if things worked as expected:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_26_electronics.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Quick note: the popular wisdom is to buy screw-in buttons for thick panels and scap-in for thin
+ones. However, as my panel is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too thick even for screw-ins, snap-ins are actually the better
+choice: you just need to put the buttons in normally - the 2 sides of the button will push against
+the hole and keep it there fairly firmly. I never had a problem with my previous stick which was
+build this way.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/section&gt;
+&lt;section id=&quot;Actually-making-it&quot;&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;Actually making it&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;I drilled holes in the front side: first using the 30mm bit to drill halfway, then went all the way
+with the 24mm bit. This allows a small button to be placed deep into the case, avoiding
+accidentally button presses.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_06_front_holes.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Then I glued the case body together. I didn’t have big clamps laying around so I had to make do
+with an elastic string. It worked terribly though.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_07_glue_body.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Note that the bottom panel was just there to keep the whole thing in shape. I took it out later:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_08_glue_body2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;See the gap in the top left corner? That’s the gap I was talking about earlier. Good thing I had a
+spare piece laying around, so I sawed it to the correct length to use as a replacement:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_09_saw_side.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Now everything fitted together but there was some excess on one long side. Much sanding awaits!&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_10_excess.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Initial sanding effort with 140 grit sandpaper:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_11_sanded.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;By the way, I recommend using a sanding block. It helps you apply more pressure evenly. I simply
+wrapped my sandpaper around a spare piece of MDF:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_12_sanding_block.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Now on to the inner sides. These would support the top and bottom panels. I used a long piece of
+scrap plexiglass to apply pressure instead of a clamp. This time I put one 10mm-thick wood panel
+and one 3mm-thick plexiglass panel under it to make sure the inner supports are glued at the
+correct position.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_13_inner_support.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;With all 3 inner sides glued:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_14_inner_support2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Now you must be wondering why I had 2 inner pieces on the left side. I originally wanted to save
+some space and weight by sawing those into shorter support bits instead of long whole pieces that
+covered the full length. After sawing the first piece I decided that it wasn’t worth the effort
+anyway so… there you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Here comes the next challenge: putting paint on the MDF. There is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.shoryuken.com/discussion/67501/how-to-paint-mdf-to-a-mirror-finish-worklog&quot;&gt;extremely elaborate
+method&lt;/a&gt; explained on Shoryuken Tech Talk that helps you achieve a mirror-like glossy
+finish. Of course I don’t have the tools and patience to follow all that, but I followed the first
+few steps (cover edges with non-absorbent material, sand and spray paint multiple times) to achieve
+an acceptably smooth finish.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Here’s the first step: cover edges with non-absorbent material. The tutorial suggested using
+spackling, which I have no idea how to obtain from here. I settled with something Vietnamese people
+“matic” (mastic, perhaps?) which my friends said was to be used for the same purpose. The thing was
+yellow-ish and much more runny than spackling. It was also difficult as hell to work with: the
+moment it’s spread on the MDF edge, it starts drying, at which point you can’t touch it again
+unless you want an ugly grungy finish (is that even a word?):&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_15_mastic.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;I waited for the yellow thing to dry, then sanded it again. After a first few coats with glossy
+black spray paint, things didn’t look too sexy:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_16_first_coat.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;It did get better with sanding (1200 grit) and more coats though. But then I made the most stupid
+decision: glueing the top panel on before drilling:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_17_top_panel.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Now why was this bad? Because now I would be forced to drill top panel holes &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the whole body
+attached, which will expose the whole thing to sawdust, which was generally PITA to clean up - the
+top panel made it a closed shape with corners and spaces all over the place. Also, if I screwed up
+the top MDF panel (which I eventually kinda did), the whole thing would be ruined.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;As if that wasn’t enough, I did paint it too. The paint layer would later make disgusting drill
+holes:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_18_joystick_hole.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;But I’m getting ahead of myself. Here’s how the case looked after a few more black coats and one
+clear coat (also put buttons in there to see how they fit):&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_19_finished_coat.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;I did drill an extra button hole because I realized I’d need the “Playstation” button too if I want
+to use a PS4 controller PCB later (which I plan to do). Unfortunately I only ordered 2 small
+buttons from Akishop so I had to use a green Chinese button I had laying around.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Now here comes the hard part: drilling the top panel. As mentioned earlier, the top panel would be
+3-layer:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_02_top_plan.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;I placed all 3 pieces onto the case, but with the 4mm plexiglass on top (in the plan it’s supposed
+to be in the middle - I’ll explain later). Then I printed the Blast City button layout found on
+Slagcoin and taped it onto the whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_20_top_layout.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Notice the extra two holes I drew above and below the joystick hole. Those are for screw holes for
+mounting the joystick. This is why I put the 4mm piece on top: I was going to drill these two holes
+on the 4mm piece only to leave room for screw heads. This way I didn’t need to “route” the extra 2
+holes on my MDF piece like the original plan (I was afraid the 10mm MDF thickness was already too
+thin).&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;After drilling the necessary holes, I removed the plexiglass pieces and drilled the aformentioned 2
+joystick mounting holes into to MDF, then I placed the joystick mounting plate onto the surface to
+plot the rectangular part that needed to be cut off:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_21_joystick_square.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Since I don’t have any power tool, I used my handy hand drill with the circular hole saw to
+gradually drill out the shape:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_22_joystick_drills.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;After much sanding and cleaning:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_18_joystick_hole.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;See the glorious tears? That’s what premature painting does to you. Friends don’t let friends paint
+prematurely!&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I also drilled 3 hole on the bottom to install the bottom pieces (1 MDF &amp;amp; 1 plexiglass). I
+also printed a quick picture as a placeholder artwork to see how it would look:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_23_bottom.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;As I was excited to finish the putting the top panel together, I hit a wall: because I couldn’t
+possibly drill perfectly perpendicular screw holes, they could not property attach:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_25_loose_screw.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Also, thanks to the switching positions between the two plexiglass pieces, the button holes didn’t
+align anymore. I had to waste a buttload of time sanding the lower piece’s holes to make them
+bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;But that’s not even the worst issue: because the screw holes were not aligned, once I screwed all
+four corners, the top plexiglass piece flexed, creating a blatantly noticeable gap:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;fightstick_24_gap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/section&gt;
+&lt;section id=&quot;Um-that-s-it-for-now&quot;&gt;
+&lt;h2&gt;Um… that’s it (for now).&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;That’s all of my progress so far. I’m visiting my &lt;a href=&quot;http://fablabsaigon.org/&quot;&gt;local Fablab&lt;/a&gt;, which is advertised to
+have CNC machines and laser cutters so I’ll probably have a chance to produce more accurate panels.
+Hell, I may even redo the whole thing using machine-cut pieces for absolute accuracy and save
+myself from a world of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Till next time!&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;/section&gt;

+&lt;h2&gt;I did it!&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;I was almost done in Part 1, except for the fact that button holes on the top panels didn’t align,
+and the topmost panel flexed a bit because of imprecise screw holes:&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ewww&quot; src=&quot;../fightstick-1/fightstick_24_gap.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;To fix the button holes, I simply wrapped my roughest sandpaper around the drill bit and used it as
+a poor man’s sander to make the holes slightly bigger, just enough for buttons to fit. This took a
+while because the sandpaper pieces kept failing on me. Good thing I stock a huge roll in the first
+place! :-)&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;The flexing panel was surprisingly trivial to fix: I simply made one corner’s hole a bit bigger to
+allow its screw to go all the way in properly. No more stupid gaps!&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;Now that every piece was how it should be, the fun part began: assembling. The inside looked like

+the PCB doesn’t get yanked around. Later on I actually labeled every pair of wires for each button
+and secured the PCB better with more resilient tape, but I forgot to take photos and I’m now too
+lazy to open up the whole thing again so… you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;As for the top panel artwork, I planned quite a few colored designs, but was too lazy to go to a

+&lt;h2&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;All in all, this turned out much better than I expected. The whole thing feels solid to play with,
+and the plexiglass top panel makes a nice feeling palm rest. However, since I went a bit liberal on
+panel layers, it’s a tad heavier than my previous stick (which is already heavier than your average
+big brand sticks). On the flip side, I can be more aggressive with my joystick spinning sessions
+thanks to the extra weight.&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;I’m also thinking of adding non-slip padding to the bottom. I almost exclusively play with the
+fightstick on my lap so it’s not actually necessary gameplay-wise, but without padding, the bottom
+screw heads stick out and would definitely scratch my table whenever I place the stick on it.
+Better be safe than sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
+&lt;p&gt;That’s it! This project has been fun, and to me it served as an awesome gateway drug to the DIY
+world. Hopefully I inspired some of you to start your own projects too. Let me know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
