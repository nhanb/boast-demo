 Although Manjaro comes packed with most of the apps that I would install on any other distro
 anyway: GIMP, LibreOffice, Steam, etc., here are some additional steps I took to make it rock.
 
+## If you get a default xfce environment after setup...
+
+It happened to me when I tried to mount my existing `/home` partition. Instead of the beautiful

+I guess it was because of some weird bug that the partition ended up being owned by `root` so the
